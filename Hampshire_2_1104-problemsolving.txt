At Rackspace, the most important skills noted for achieving employment were problem-solving and active code development.

For example, presenters noted that they would be most likely to hire someone who goes home and spends hours working with Linux and networking.

Does that describe you? Why or why not?

-No because my main interest lies outside of programming and networking.

Similarly, presenters noted a demand for employees who were good at independent problem solving. Does that describe you? Why or why not?

-In some ways yes because I can figure out how to solve most problems on my own but sometimes I need some help.

Have you finished your disk image? Why or why not? 
-No, I am almost done but need a little more time.
