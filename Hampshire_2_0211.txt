tcpdump -nS
tcpdump -w writes to a file, e.g., tcpdump -w lastname_0211.pcap
To capture traffic for a specific port: tcpdump port ??
To cature traffic on a specific interface: tcpdump -i eth0
In Linux, to list interfaces, type ifconfig (as root)
Given the above - what is the command to capture most/all web based traffic on your computer to a file lastname_0211.pcap?
Use that command to begin a packet capture.
